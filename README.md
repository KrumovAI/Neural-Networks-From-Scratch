# neural-networks-from-scratch
This is a personal implementation of a Neural Network model.

You may check my Medium.com article I wrote on this topic called [Neural Networks: For Beginners. By Beginners.](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-for-beginners-by-beginners-6bfc002e13a2)

Implemented layers:
- Fully-Connected
- Activation
- Convolution
- Pooling
- - Max Pooling
- Dropout
- Flatten
